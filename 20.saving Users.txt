                                                20.Saving Users

[Taking the user information and Saving it to the Database]

STEP 1 :
        [checking whether it is a post req or get req. if it is post doing something,if it is get doing different thing]
        In accounts/views.py
            from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
            from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm


            def signup_view(request) :
                if request.method == 'POST' :
                    form = UserCreationForm(request.POST) //validate the form details and return the result
                                                        //request.POST holds the form data
                    if form.is_valid() : //return the form is valid or not
                        form.save() // if the form is valid save thr form data
                        #log the user [later]
                        return redirect('articles:list') // articles is appName nd list is name of the url in articles app
                else :
                    form = UserCreationForm()
                return render(request, 'accounts/signup.html', {"form" : form})

    There are Three scenarios.
    case 1 :
            The method is post -> if part get execute -> validating the form -> form.is_valid == True -> saving the form/logging nd redirect
    
    case 2 :
            The method is get -> else part get execute -> one blank new form appears in the screen.
        
    Case 3 :
            The method is post -> if part get execute -> validating the form -> form.is_valid == False -> return statment after the else part gets execute with validated form with error.[errors displays on the screen]
            
            
STEP 2:
    [fill the form and submit we get the csrf tokken is missing or incorrect.] 
    To rectify this error. send csrf token with the form.

    In accounts/templates/accounts/signup.html

            {% extends 'base_layout.html' %}

            {% block content %}
                <p>signup</p>
                <form class='' action='/accounts/signup/' method='post'>
                    {% csrf_token %}
                    {{ form }}
                    <input type='submit' value='signUp'/>
                </form>

            {% endblock %}
 
 STEP 3 :
    now we can fill the form and submit and new User got Created.
    And we can see the signed up user name in the '/admin/' user
